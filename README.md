I have built this just for you!!I know you forget to finish couple of things .Here I am with a TODO site.
* you can make a list of your daily tasks.
* when you finish a task you can just mark it as completed and can see the list of completed tasks!
* you can delete the completed task!
* The active tasks list will be shown !
* Lastly,there are two modes ,day and night !!
